## Overview

For our culminating project, we've created a demo booking system application based around the 2026 World Cup. The program consists of two parts, a website (frontend), and an API server (backend). The frontend handles interactions with the user in a graphical context, while the backend handles logic behind the scenes, such as providing the frontend with data (user purchased tickets, game data).

To accomplish this, we made use of TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript) in combination with React, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces on websites and apps. The reason we opted to use TypeScript over regular JavaScript is because it provides static typings to the language, which makes it even more similar in syntax to Java than it already was. 

## Concepts Implemented

In this project, we made sure to use concepts from everything we've learned in this course, including file reading/writing, arrays. classes/objects, iteration, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and recursion.
